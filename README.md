# BIOS626_Midterm

## Project Description 
### Objective

For this project, we will built two classifiers to predict participants' activities using the motion signals captured by their smartwatches. The activities include three static postures (standing, sitting, lying), three dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs, and walking upstairs), and postural transitions that occurred between the static postures. There are two tasks: 

1. Build a binary classifier to classify the activity of each time window into static (0) and dynamic (1). For this task, consider postural transitions as static (0). 
2. Build a refined multi-class classifier to classify walking (1), walking_upstairs (2), walking_downstairs (3), sitting (4), standing (5), lying (6), and static postural transition (7)
